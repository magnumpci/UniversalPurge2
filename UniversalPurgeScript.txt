Create menu script

Intro:
This script is meant to purge a Stardock app and download current version for reinstall (if that is the goal).

This script will do the following:
-Ask what app you want to purge (and potentially reinstall)
-Get the needed files from the Internet (Stardock) based on your selection
-Ask if you are wanting to perform the process on this PC or another (does not have Internet)
-Based on that choice, ask you to continue (on this PC) or what to do next if it is to be done on another.

App selection:
-Fences
-Multiplicity

Multiplicity was selected, do you just want to purge the application or purge and reinstall?
-Just purge
-Purge and reinstall
